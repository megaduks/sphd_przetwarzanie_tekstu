00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:51,300

8
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,339
<i>Part of a wave of
memorials and protests</i>

9
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,416
<i>demanding that the secretive
monster-hunting coalition</i>

10
00:01:57,495 --> 00:02:00,080
<i>known as Monarch
be held accountable.</i>

11
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:03,823
<i>The recent spike in mass
die-offs in the world's oceans</i>

12
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:07,080
<i>could be caused by efforts
to locate and track Godzilla</i>

13
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:09,237

<i>A historic tragedy that changed

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,165
<i>The day the world discovered

- Uh...
- Maddie?

31
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,992
Good morning!

32
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:14,540
- Morning, Mom!
- Oh, God.

33
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,961
I made us breakfast.

34
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,196
It's, uh...

35
00:03:22,313 --> 00:03:25,532
eggs, toast
and what was once... bacon.

36
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,735
And which do you recommend?

37
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:30,485
The toasted eggs.

38
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,414
Thank you.

39
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:36,946
Coffee?

40
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,327
What were you working on?

41
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:44,500
Um, I was looking at recipes.

42
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:46,570
For toast?

43
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:51,657
Dad's been emailing me.

44
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:54,477
But he looks good... healthy.

45
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:59,382
- Have you responded?
- Not yet.

46
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,359
Madison, I just don't
want to see you get hurt.

47
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:02,384
I know.

48
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,935
Especially with everything
that's going on right now...

49
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,132
Mom, I know.

50
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:12,742
Listen, I know things
haven't been easy for you.

51
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:17,461
But we're gonna get
through this... together.

52
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,499
You sure he's gonna be okay?

53
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:22,968
He is in the safest place
that he could be right now.

54
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:27,199
Wanna hear some good news?

55
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,198
I finished it.

56
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:48,065
Really?

57
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:52,433
You think it's gonna work?

58
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,370
It's gonna work.

59
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:18,106
It's gonna be okay.

60
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:22,762
<i>Dr. Russell, we need you
in containment.</i>

61
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:25,453
I'm on my way.

62
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:37,419
Monarch Outpost 61
Yunnan Rainforest, China.

63
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,957
- What the hell happened?
- No idea.

64
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:41,880
She was sleeping like a
baby until an hour ago

65
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,091
and then boom! Radiation levels
went through the roof.

66
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,779
Almost like something
triggered it.

67
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:46,982
Thanks, Tim.

68
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:49,029
You know, I can take it from here.
Why don't you get some rest?

69
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,114
No way. Sleep or no sleep,
I'm not missing this.

70
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:09,047
<i>Containment team,
move into primary position.</i>

71
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,819
Sedatives?

72
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:14,382
No effect. This thing
wants to be born.

73
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:19,546
<i>Emergency protocols in effect.</i>

74
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,320
<i>Two to assist the primary team.</i>

75
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:23,281
The time has come.

76
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:53,696
Meet Titanus mosura.

77
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:55,195
Or as we like to call her...

78
00:06:55,258 --> 00:06:56,704
Mothra.

79
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:58,361
Incredible.

80
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,001
<i>Activate containment grid.</i>

81
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:11,453
What's happening?

82
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:16,946
Something's really wrong here.

83
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:18,758
Containment systems
are failing.

84
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,992
Perimeter alarms are going off,
the whole network's going insane.

85
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:22,773
What do you mean?
How is that possible?

86
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:24,539
Emma, I think someone
else is doing this.

87
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:30,143
<i>Containment team, stand down.</i>

88
00:07:30,197 --> 00:07:32,595
I repeat, stand down.
You are scaring her.

89
00:07:58,804 --> 00:07:59,804
No!

90
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,381
Dr. Russell, I'm sorry,
but you know the protocols.

91
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:02,406
We have to terminate.

92
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:03,593
I'll handle this.

93
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,118
Mom, no!

94
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,342
Madison, stay here.
It's gonna work.

95
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:14,288
<i>Stand clear.</i>

96
00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:23,116
It's okay.

97
00:09:00,817 --> 00:09:01,998
Mom!

98
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:09,299
Mom!

99
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,864
Maddie, wait!

100
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,736
Get back in here!

101
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:18,963
Maddie, go back!

102
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:21,876
Look out!

103
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,259
Mom...

104
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:02,788
Son of a bitch.

105
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:05,116
It worked.

106
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:20,551
What we are witnessing
here, senators,

107
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:25,364
is the return of an ancient
and forgotten super species.

108
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,190
Monarch Senate Hearings
- Godzilla, the MUTOs, Kong.

109
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:32,812
We believe that these Titans
and others like them

110
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:35,705
provide an essential
balance to our world.

111
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,970
And while some
may pose a threat,

112
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:41,244
Monarch is uniquely
prepared to determine

113
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,970
which of these Titans
are here to threaten us

114
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:46,651
and which of these Titans
are here to protect us.

115
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:50,057
Thank you for the 5th grade
History lesson, Mr. Coleman.

116
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,463
But we still haven't
heard one good reason

117
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:55,775
why Monarch shouldn't fall
under military jurisdiction

118
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:58,237
or why these creatures
shouldn't be exterminated.

119
00:11:58,354 --> 00:11:59,885
Monarch was tasked

120
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,510
with finding and destroying
these radioactive monsters.

121
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:06,798
But you either can't or won't
tell us how many there are

122
00:12:06,823 --> 00:12:08,588
or why they're showing up.

123
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,127
So, maybe it's time for the
military to put them down.

124
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:14,307
Killing them would be a mistake.

125
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:16,284
They returned because of us.

126
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:20,385
It was our atomic testing
that awoke Godzilla.

127
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:22,737
Other creatures like the MUTOs

128
00:12:22,762 --> 00:12:25,543
from strip mining
and seismic surveys.

129
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:28,341
But these are not monsters.

130
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:31,911
They are animals rising to reclaim
a world that was once theirs.

131
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:35,497
It almost sounds like you're
protecting them, Dr. Serizawa.

132
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,021
As if you admire them.

133
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,857
I admire all forms of life.

134
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:43,225
Senators, if we hope to survive,

135
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:46,927
we must find ways to
coexist with Titans.

136
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,975
With Godzilla.

137
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,420
A sort of symbiotic
relationship, if you will.

138
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:55,230
Like The Lion and the Mouse.

139
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:57,247
Or The Scorpion and the Frog.

140
00:12:57,451 --> 00:13:00,349
So you'd want to make
Godzilla our pet?

141
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:01,662
No.

142
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:03,647
We would be his.

143
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,989
Uh, no. No, actually.

144
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:13,301
That's not what
Dr. Serizawa meant.

145
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,489
No one is implying that...

146
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:15,834
- we would be Godzilla's
- Excuse me, we have to go.

147
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:16,862
or anyone's pet.

148
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:20,044
Dr. Serizawa, Dr. Graham,
this hearing is not adjourned.

149
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,661
Dr. Serizawa!
I hope you understand

150
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:25,294
the consequences of
walking out that door.

151
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:28,364
Uh, you know what, senators, while
I confer with my colleagues here,

152
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:30,487
I'm gonna set you up
with a very brief

153
00:13:30,514 --> 00:13:33,284
and pretty fun documentary
on Titan reproduction.

154
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:35,541
I think this is the one where
the genitals are blurred out.

155
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,632
But if not, uh, you can leave
a comment with my assistant.

156
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:43,851
Colorado

157
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:42,243
The feed cuts out there.

158
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:44,985
The survivors haven't
been able to give us

159
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,048
much more than what
the footage allows.

160
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:50,243
Only that Emma and Madison
were the only ones taken.

161
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:53,423
I'm sorry, Mark.

162
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:55,329
I should've been there for 'em.

163
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,087
- Who are they?
- We don't know yet.

164
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:02,790
We believe...

165
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:04,868
they were after this.

166
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:09,612
- You didn't.
- It's the Orca.

167
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,932
Uh, that's why we
think they need Emma.

168
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:14,198
She believed that if we
could somehow replicate

169
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:15,901
the biosonar the Titans
use to communicate...

170
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:18,261
I know what the hell it is.
I helped build the prototype.

171
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:20,737
Who is he?

172
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,969
Uh, Sam Coleman,
I'm the head of Technology.

173
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:25,386
I joined Monarch, uh,
shortly after you left.

174
00:15:25,502 --> 00:15:28,073
I'm a big fan
of your wife...'s work

175
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:30,526
and you... that's not even...
so weird. I'm sorry.

176
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:32,073
Emma and I destroyed
the prototype.

177
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,698
And then Emma decided
to rebuild it.

178
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:37,698
After San Francisco,
she went home to Boston,

179
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:39,542
spent years developing it.

180
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,846
- She thought it could help.
- Help what? Play God?

181
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:43,682
No. Help prevent another attack.

182
00:15:43,714 --> 00:15:45,135
Orca was a grad school
science project.

183
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,268
It was meant to

184
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:47,964
t-to keep whales
away from the shoreline.

185
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,316
Not so you could talk to your
little creatures out there.

186
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,705
Listen to me.

187
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,277
They'll think it's one of them.

188
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:56,308
You use the wrong
frequency on one of 'em...

189
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:59,496
and you're gonna be responsible
for a thousand San Franciscos.

190
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,707
Which is why we
need to get it back.

191
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:03,793
Emma always said,

192
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:06,129
no one knew the Orca
better than you.

193
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:08,199
It shouldn't even exist.

194
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,512
That may be, Mark, but
it's fallen into the wrong hands.

195
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:13,355
And right now, the Orca

196
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,605
is the only thing keeping
Emma and Madison alive.

197
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,745
Mark, we know you're hurting.

198
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:21,863
But if we find the Orca,
we'll find your family.

199
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,730
I promise.

200
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:36,761
When was the last time
you spoke to Emma?

201
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:39,675
About three years ago.

202
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:42,378
After San Francisco, we...

203
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,277
we went back home to Boston.

204
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:48,245
Tried to put the
pieces back together.

205
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,776
Emma dealt with it by doubling
down on saving the world.

206
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:54,449
I started drinking.

207
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:58,815
I can't tell you how
much I hated myself

208
00:16:58,862 --> 00:17:00,941
for letting Maddie
see me that way.

209
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:05,495
Uh, you mind if we cut in here?

210
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:08,941
It's just, you're gonna...
wanna see this.

211
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,933
Emma combined the bioacoustics
of different Titans

212
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,972
to create the Orca's signal.

213
00:17:14,997 --> 00:17:17,105
A sort of baseline frequency

214
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,847
that all the
creatures respond to.

215
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:20,957
Attracting them, repelling them,

216
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:23,724
even at times,
calming them down.

217
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:25,396
It's pretty remarkable, actually.

218
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,302
The problem is, we don't know
which Titans she combined.

219
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,435
But if you can identify
those frequencies,

220
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:33,497
we'll be able to track the Orca

221
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:35,638
and find Emma and Madison.

222
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,223
Jesus.

223
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:39,746
How many of these
things are there?

224
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,185
17...

225
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:43,083
And counting, after Godzilla.

226
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:44,247
17?

227
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,403
Most of them were discovered
in deep hibernation.

228
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:50,114
While others we contained at top
secret sites around the globe.

229
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:52,583
Cambodia, Mexico, Skull Island.

230
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,762
We even found one in Wyoming.

231
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,536
They're everywhere.

232
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:58,058
Why don't you kill 'em?

233
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,614
The government wants to.

234
00:18:00,224 --> 00:18:04,348
But Emma and I believe
some are benevolent.

235
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:08,021
Don't kid yourself.

236
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:13,192
Ah, hey, look at that.
We're here.

237
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:27,075
<i>Castle Bravo, this is Raptor One
on direct approach.</i>

238
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:32,825
Castle Bravo
Monarch Outpost 54, Bermuda

239
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:37,661
<i>Raptor One, you are cleared
for assisted descent to Pad 4.</i>

240
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:48,130
<i>Sensors set for three meters.</i>

241
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:49,958
<i>Beginning subsurface descent.</i>

242
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:54,099
This is new.

243
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:56,973
Yeah, we call it Castle Bravo.

244
00:18:56,998 --> 00:18:59,036
Our new flagship facility.

245
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:02,083
Built to track and study
Godzilla on his own turf.

246
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:03,864
I thought he was missing?

247
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:06,114
Well, only if you don't
know where to look.

248
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:19,966
As you know,
at approximately 0700 hours,

249
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,778
our containment site

250
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:24,380
in China's Yunnan
Rainforest was raided.

251
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:27,466
A specimen, code-named
Mothra, escaped.

252
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:30,427
Only to cocoon itself later
under a nearby waterfall.

253
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:32,786
Our Dr. Emma Russell

254
00:19:32,903 --> 00:19:35,364
and her daughter Madison
were taken hostage.

255
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:37,833
This is the man responsible.

256
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,497
Alan Jonah.

257
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:42,857
A former British Army colonel
turned eco-terrorist.

258
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:45,341
Obsessed with restoring
the natural order.

259
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:47,199
And to fund his operations,

260
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:50,560
he began trafficking in a
new and dangerous market:

261
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,169
Titan DNA.

262
00:19:52,194 --> 00:19:54,200
What the hell's someone
gonna do with a giant worm?

263
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:56,427
You kiddin', Martinez?
What can't you do with it?

264
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:59,263
Pharmaceuticals,
bioweapons, food.

265
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:02,442
Hell, there isn't a country
or a company on the planet

266
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:05,067
that doesn't wanna get its
hands on one of these suckers.

267
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:07,528
And remember,
this is just a larva.

268
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:10,661
That's a baby.
After it cocoons,

269
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,497
somethin' else is
gonna crawl out.

270
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:14,169
Somethin' bigger.

271
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,122
- Meaner.
- We don't know that, Rick.

272
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:18,810
Oh, yeah? Just...
wait for it, Chen.

273
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:22,497
Our Intel indicates that Jonah
wants to capture this specimen.

274
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:23,661
Alive.

275
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:26,341
Which means that he and his
mercs won't be far behind.

276
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:29,396
At 0500, we'll ship out to
launch a joint operation...

277
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:30,857
I wouldn't bother.

278
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:32,137
Excuse me?

279
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:33,426
Sounds like a duck hunt to me.

280
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,229
Uh, Mark, why don't we
let Colonel Foster...

281
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:37,317
A decoy, a diversion.

282
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:40,239
Look, they've already
got Emma and the Orca.

283
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:41,629
Why would they
want just this one,

284
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:42,926
when they've got the
keys to your entire

285
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,263
magic kingdom of
horrors back here?

286
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,583
I think that they want you
to go after this Mothra

287
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,403
so they can go
after a real prize.

288
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:51,927
Something bigger.

289
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:53,810
Right.

290
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:57,825
Mark, this is not the first
specimen they've captured.

291
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,075
They know what they are doing.

292
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,122
That's not just a specimen.

293
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:02,560
I've got an ex-wife and
a daughter out there,

294
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:03,849
in case you forgot.

295
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,778
Well, no one has
forgotten that, Mark.

296
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:09,345
But, uh, to remind you, you were
brought on here to track the Orca.

297
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:10,442
And to advise us...

298
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:13,513
I advise you to kill these things.
All of 'em!

299
00:21:13,575 --> 00:21:15,021
Especially him.

300
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,769
You wanna make sure these things
don't fall into the wrong hands?

301
00:21:17,794 --> 00:21:19,894
You kill them,
and the Orca is useless.

302
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,003
Emma wouldn't have wanted that.

303
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:23,903
Even to save her life.

304
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:27,551
It wouldn't be the first time
Emma put all of this before herself

305
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:29,222
or her family, would it?

306
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:36,021
Dude hates Titans.

307
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:38,873
Yeah, well, you would too,
if you were him.

308
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:46,372
<i>Outpost 32, this is Raptor Five</i>

309
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:48,428
<i>on approach with
reinforcements and supplies.</i>

310
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:49,779
<i>Requesting permission to land.</i>

311
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:52,519
<i>Serizawa has all
sites on high alert,</i>

312
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,871
<i>so transmitting
emergency codes now.</i>

313
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:56,543
<i>Copy that, Raptor Five.</i>

314
00:21:57,074 --> 00:21:59,621
<i>Codes are good.
Nice to have you back.</i>

315
00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:03,489
Antarctica
Monarch Outpost 32

316
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:07,379
Go.

317
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:36,283
I'm scared.

318
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,143
I know. Me too.

319
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,337
Okay.

320
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,994
Let's go.

321
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,961
Eyes straight ahead.

322
00:22:59,469 --> 00:23:00,898
Deep breaths.

323
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:02,719
Just like we talked about.

324
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:44,488
Mother of God.

325
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:47,527
She had nothing to do with this.

326
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:58,012
Monster Zero.

327
00:24:21,007 --> 00:24:22,429
Any survivors?

328
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:23,509
No.

329
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:25,069
They tried to launch
an emergency beacon,

330
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:26,460
but we cut them off in time.

331
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:27,820
They'll figure it out.

332
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,624
Fire all the drills.

333
00:24:31,414 --> 00:24:33,171
Do you have everything you need?

334
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:35,210
Good!

335
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:37,312
Let's get started.

336
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:06,846
<i>We have a grizzly situation
up here in the attic.</i>

337
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:08,658
<i>Come on, Andrew. Andrew.</i>

338
00:25:13,242 --> 00:25:15,265
<i>Stop. Look.</i>

339
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:17,572
<i>An intruder! Get her!</i>

340
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,960
<i>- Get her!
- No! No, don't get me!</i>

341
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,492
<i>Andrew, Madison, get her!</i>

342
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:25,867
<i>Bear kisses! Aaah!</i>

343
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:40,125
<i>All personnel, report to
battle stations. Code: Red.</i>

344
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:44,546
<i>All personnel, report to
battle stations. Code: Red.</i>

345
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:46,601
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

346
00:25:46,773 --> 00:25:50,593
<i>All personnel, report to
battle stations. Code: Red.</i>

347
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,445
What's happening?

348
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:55,812
Something's wrong.

349
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,643
He's never been
this close before.

350
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:59,886
- Who's "he"?
- Who do you think?

351
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:03,815
He's taking out our
observation drones.

352
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:06,238
- Trajectory?
- Straight at us.

353
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:08,316
1,200 meters and closing.

354
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:12,370
G-Team! Barnes, Martinez, Hendrix,
I want you on those crows, now!

355
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,792
You heard boss lady!
Let's move!

356
00:26:24,753 --> 00:26:27,011
Dr. Stanton,
do you have his bioacoustics?

357
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,573
Acoustics, comin' up.

358
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:32,159
Okay, he's closing.
We're at 800 meters.

359
00:26:32,238 --> 00:26:33,713
His movements are erratic.

360
00:26:33,738 --> 00:26:35,324
Heart and breathing elevated.

361
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:37,729
He's definitely not
happy about something.

362
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:39,026
How are they getting him?

363
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,198
Godzilla's bioacoustics.

364
00:26:41,323 --> 00:26:43,104
It allows us to track him.

365
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,949
Even to get his vitals.

366
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:50,956
Circling now.
Closing in, 200 meters.

367
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:52,326
Colonel.

368
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:54,497
All teams in position.
Weapons cocked.

369
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,535
Ready to engage
on my command.

370
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,035
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

371
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:01,383
Hold your fire.

372
00:27:01,484 --> 00:27:03,188
We don't know if he will attack.

373
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,433
He will if you keep
those guns on him.

374
00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:07,185
Now, I want him dead
more than anybody

375
00:27:07,256 --> 00:27:09,600
but unless this is a fight
that you know that you can win,

376
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:11,249
for God's sake, stand down.

377
00:27:18,295 --> 00:27:19,388
Stand down.

378
00:27:19,716 --> 00:27:20,810
You can't be serious.

379
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:21,903
I am.

380
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,465
Stand down.

381
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,238
Stand down.

382
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:31,207
I say again, safety your weapons.
Do not engage.

383
00:27:35,242 --> 00:27:36,484
Listen.

384
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,976
His heart rate... it's slowing.

385
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:49,726
Open the shields.

386
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:52,843
Oh, yeah, sure, let's
bring him in for a beer.

387
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,844
You outta your goddamn mind?

388
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:57,305
Let him know we're not a threat.

389
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,013
Open the shields.

390
00:28:05,722 --> 00:28:06,941
Do it.

391
00:28:41,463 --> 00:28:42,823
Hey, what's with the light show?

392
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,612
It's an intimidation display.

393
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:49,152
Like a gorilla pounding its chest.

394
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:52,676
Consider us very intimidated.

395
00:28:54,288 --> 00:28:56,491
I don't think it's for us.

396
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:07,141
What are you doing, dude?

397
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,399
Well, that was interesting.

398
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:50,773
Could we maybe
close the shield now?

399
00:29:51,882 --> 00:29:54,132
Show me his territorial routes.

400
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:55,460
W-Why?

401
00:29:55,513 --> 00:29:57,638
Because I wanna start a boat tour.
Just show me!

402
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,255
Coming up.

403
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:02,083
You care to tell us
what you're looking for?

404
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,624
When an animal leaves
its hunting ground,

405
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:05,780
it's usually because its
threatened by something.

406
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,235
Run a course projection.

407
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:08,805
We've gotta go after him.

408
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:11,001
He's looking for
something out there.

409
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:13,227
It could be the Orca.

410
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:18,615
Dr. Stanton,
what's your projection?

411
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,718
All paths have him
landing in the same place.

412
00:30:23,265 --> 00:30:24,537
Antarctica.

413
00:30:24,562 --> 00:30:25,789
Good, then.

414
00:30:26,288 --> 00:30:28,913
I mean, let's go!
Let's go find him, let's...

415
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:31,186
Wait.

416
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:32,991
What's in Antarctica?

417
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:34,376
Barnes.

418
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:35,860
Contact the Argo.

419
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:37,384
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:30:46,976 --> 00:30:49,195
USS Argo
Monarch Command Ship

421
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:53,156
The specimen at this site has
been kept entirely off book.

422
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:56,633
And since it's a more recent
discovery, our data is limited.

423
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:59,914
But it seems to be
another apex predator.

424
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,750
Emma called it "Monster Zero".

425
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:05,044
It may have been a
rival Alpha to Godzilla,

426
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,718
battling for dominance
over the other Titans.

427
00:31:07,796 --> 00:31:08,913
Dr. Chen?

428
00:31:08,998 --> 00:31:13,357
I've been scouring through thousands
of years of myths and legends.

429
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:17,522
But it's almost as if people were
scared to even write about it.

430
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,561
As if it was meant
to be forgotten.

431
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:22,077
So, I hate to crash the party,
but I got some bad news.

432
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:24,187
You could just say "news".
It's always bad.

433
00:31:24,212 --> 00:31:25,434
We lost Godzilla.

434
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:27,448
Dropped off the
scan near Venezuela.

435
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:28,527
Dropped off?

436
00:31:28,581 --> 00:31:31,316
I'm telling you, Dr. Brooks
was right. It's a hollow Earth.

437
00:31:31,341 --> 00:31:33,651
That's how he moves
around so fast,

438
00:31:33,714 --> 00:31:36,401
using these underwater
tunnels like wormholes

439
00:31:36,425 --> 00:31:38,292
just like... zippin' around.

440
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:39,886
Everyone look sharp!

441
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,519
We're approaching the base.

442
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:52,751
They're here.

443
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:54,157
Keep 'em busy.

444
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:56,063
Merge reaction force.

445
00:31:56,155 --> 00:31:57,227
Move out!

446
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,954
If Jonah is looking to
extract genetic samples,

447
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:23,439
they'll be here.

448
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:24,837
In the biolabs.

449
00:32:25,102 --> 00:32:28,587
Alright, two minutes! Check your
equipment. Stand by the door.

450
00:32:46,982 --> 00:32:48,959
Come on, Ash, make it snappy.

451
00:32:50,842 --> 00:32:52,943
- Detonator ready.
- Let's go.

452
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,170
Come on, Maddie.

453
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:55,349
Move, move!

454
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:16,255
Remember, eyes wide.
We got friendlies in here.

455
00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:20,304
<i>Movin' to tunnel two.</i>

456
00:33:41,609 --> 00:33:43,031
<i>Ambush! Ambush!</i>

457
00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:51,328
It's an ambush!
We're taking heavy fi...!

458
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,937
<i>Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
We got friendlies!</i>

459
00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:01,055
Mark!

460
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:04,968
Get down there and help Barnes.
I'm goin' after 'em.

461
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,022
Roger that.

462
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,645
Hey, guys...

463
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:22,879
I'm getting an EKG reading.

464
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:29,176
Emma!

465
00:34:29,762 --> 00:34:30,863
Maddie!

466
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:41,288
Barnes, this is Foster.

467
00:34:41,586 --> 00:34:44,789
I've got eyes on the target.
Repeat: eyes on the target.

468
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:52,046
Let 'em go!

469
00:34:54,147 --> 00:34:55,148
Ash!

470
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:56,173
Dad!

471
00:34:58,085 --> 00:34:59,006
Mark.

472
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,093
Emma, Madison, let's go!

473
00:35:01,118 --> 00:35:02,132
Dad.

474
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:03,867
Let's go. Emma, Maddie, come on.

475
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:06,109
- Daddy.
- Madison, walk to me!

476
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:07,820
Walk to me now.

477
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,195
Come on, honey.

478
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,117
Barnes, I've got two
hostages, one target down.

479
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,336
- Maddie, come on!
- I do not have a shot.

480
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:14,101
Repeat: I do not have a shot.

481
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:15,937
Emma, what are you doing?
Let's go! Come on!

482
00:35:15,962 --> 00:35:17,742
- Dad...
- Maddie.

483
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:19,867
Dad.

484
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,125
Madison.

485
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,773
What the hell?

486
00:36:00,047 --> 00:36:01,250
I'm sorry.

487
00:36:03,891 --> 00:36:05,078
Run.

488
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:21,611
Maddie!

489
00:36:22,705 --> 00:36:23,760
Dad!

490
00:36:45,294 --> 00:36:46,357
Out of the way!

491
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:47,434
Get the door!

492
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:50,927
I got you!

493
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,326
We gotta go!

494
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:01,880
Dammit!

495
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:12,426
Martinez! Foster!
Let's go!

496
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:23,934
What is Dad doing here?

497
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:25,154
I don't know, honey.

498
00:37:25,234 --> 00:37:26,234
Let's go.

499
00:37:29,558 --> 00:37:30,917
We can't leave him.

500
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:32,618
What are you waiting for?

501
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:33,868
Wake it up.

502
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:48,069
Come on!

503
00:39:15,024 --> 00:39:17,243
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

504
00:39:30,154 --> 00:39:31,599
Fall back! Fall back!

505
00:39:31,724 --> 00:39:32,998
Get to the chopper!

506
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:40,515
Come on!

507
00:39:42,593 --> 00:39:43,991
Come on, hurry!

508
00:39:58,253 --> 00:40:00,956
We'll do an emergency vertical
take off at max RPMs.

509
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:02,730
Number two's now spinning up.

510
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:17,995
Oh, shit!

511
00:40:41,227 --> 00:40:42,992
This is Raptor One to Argos!

512
00:40:43,017 --> 00:40:44,750
Requesting immediate
urgent extract!

513
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:46,476
Again, I said, urgent extract!

514
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:48,226
Griffin, get us
the hell outta here!

515
00:40:50,943 --> 00:40:52,162
Madison!

516
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:54,397
Madison, no!

517
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,509
- What are you doing? Let go of it!
- No!

518
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:05,917
- Madison!
- Maddie!

519
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,341
Argo, this is Raptor One.
We've been hit.

520
00:41:42,451 --> 00:41:43,474
We're down.

521
00:43:07,695 --> 00:43:09,641
Everybody hold on!

522
00:43:30,062 --> 00:43:31,140
Mark!

523
00:43:35,244 --> 00:43:37,197
Everybody clear out!
Let's go!

524
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:39,494
Mark!

525
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:40,572
I'm stuck!

526
00:43:58,295 --> 00:43:59,552
Are you all right?

527
00:43:59,577 --> 00:44:01,193
I got it. I got it. Go, go!

528
00:45:51,561 --> 00:45:52,998
Anything on the satellites?

529
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,615
Subs have Godzilla
haulin' ass off Argentina.

530
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,139
We lost Monster Zero on a
tropical storm over Brazil.

531
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:02,130
Scanning the entire southern
hemisphere. So far, nothin'.

532
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:03,467
Then scan the northern.

533
00:46:03,492 --> 00:46:04,459
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

534
00:46:04,658 --> 00:46:05,814
I know what I saw, Sam.

535
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,420
And I'm telling you,
she pulled that trigger.

536
00:46:08,445 --> 00:46:10,465
All due respect, Colonel,
you saw wrong.

537
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:11,878
Okay? She wouldn't
have done that.

538
00:46:11,933 --> 00:46:13,986
Christ, she recruited pretty
much everyone in this room.

539
00:46:14,011 --> 00:46:16,667
Maybe Jonah forced her, right?

540
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:18,652
Maybe he used
Madison as leverage.

541
00:46:18,754 --> 00:46:20,252
No, no,
it had to be someone else.

542
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,605
Emma.

543
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:24,928
It was Emma.

544
00:46:26,379 --> 00:46:28,168
Foster saw it right.

545
00:46:28,793 --> 00:46:30,683
It was her,
no one forced her to.

546
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,168
Are you sure?

547
00:46:33,816 --> 00:46:35,502
First, she releases Mothra,

548
00:46:35,527 --> 00:46:37,597
and now, Monster Zero.

549
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:40,099
Anyone else
sensing a pattern here?

550
00:46:40,124 --> 00:46:41,897
Yes, and not a good one.

551
00:46:41,922 --> 00:46:44,709
It's as if she's trying
to start a mass awakening.

552
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:47,084
Well, it's just too bad that
no one tried to warn you that

553
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:48,599
that was gonna happen.

554
00:46:48,624 --> 00:46:49,631
Hang on, guys.

555
00:46:49,656 --> 00:46:51,842
Why the hell would she
want to release them?

556
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,295
And why would she team up with
Jonah, of all people, to do it?

557
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,294
We'll ask her

558
00:46:57,319 --> 00:46:58,959
when we find her.

559
00:46:59,969 --> 00:47:01,422
So...

560
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,850
let's keep looking.

561
00:47:17,546 --> 00:47:18,851
Godzilla appears to be following

562
00:47:18,876 --> 00:47:21,023
the same path as
Emma's Osprey,

563
00:47:21,062 --> 00:47:23,437
heading north over
South America to here.

564
00:47:23,502 --> 00:47:26,447
Outpost 56 in
Isla de Mara, Mexico.

565
00:47:26,525 --> 00:47:28,649
We touchdown there
in 10 minutes.

566
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:30,111
What about the people?

567
00:47:30,494 --> 00:47:31,783
I'm sorry?

568
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:34,182
The people. The people
down there in that village

569
00:47:34,207 --> 00:47:36,674
that don't realize they're
gonna be the 'special of the day'.

570
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:39,018
We've sent G-Team
to begin an evacuation.

571
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:41,704
Dr. Serizawa, we have a call
in the emergency channel

572
00:47:41,729 --> 00:47:43,001
from Isla de Mara.

573
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,206
Answer it.

574
00:47:53,057 --> 00:47:54,532
<i>I suppose I should go first.</i>

575
00:47:54,557 --> 00:47:55,854
Where's Madison?

576
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,659
<i>- She's right here.
- Dad, are you okay?</i>

577
00:47:58,947 --> 00:48:00,642
Madison, you alright, hon?

578
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:01,870
<i>Dad...</i>

579
00:48:03,018 --> 00:48:04,362
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

580
00:48:05,401 --> 00:48:07,417
- You don't need to be...
<i>- It's okay.</i>

581
00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:08,954
<i>I'm so... Dad?</i>

582
00:48:08,979 --> 00:48:10,674
She's fine, Mark. Trust me.

583
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:13,119
<i>Trust is a little hard
to come by, Dr. Russell.</i>

584
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,009
Especially after
what you pulled.

585
00:48:15,034 --> 00:48:16,221
<i>I know.</i>

586
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,180
And, uh, I can only imagine
what you're all thinking.

587
00:48:20,706 --> 00:48:24,573
<i>But if there were any other
way to do this, I would.</i>

588
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,526
Do what, Emma?

589
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:29,049
<i>I'm saving the world.</i>

590
00:48:29,245 --> 00:48:31,495
By releasing those things?
That doesn't make sense.

591
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,174
<i>As impossible as it seems,
it does.</i>

592
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,667
<i>Hear me out, Mark.</i>

593
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:41,604
<i>After we lost Andrew, I swore
his death would not be in vain.</i>

594
00:48:42,057 --> 00:48:43,924
<i>That I would find an answer.</i>

595
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:46,573
<i>A solution to why
the Titans were rising.</i>

596
00:48:46,651 --> 00:48:49,495
<i>But as I dug deeper,
I realized that</i>

597
00:48:49,612 --> 00:48:51,877
<i>they were here for a reason.</i>

598
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:56,291
<i>And that despite all the years that
we spent trying to stop them,</i>

599
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,487
<i>we never dared to
confront the truth.</i>

600
00:48:59,768 --> 00:49:01,151
Which truth?

601
00:49:01,228 --> 00:49:04,125
Humans have been the dominant
species for thousands of years,

602
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:05,581
and look what's happened.

603
00:49:06,198 --> 00:49:07,846
Overpopulation.

604
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:09,979
<i>Pollution.</i>

605
00:49:10,471 --> 00:49:11,721
<i>War.</i>

606
00:49:11,814 --> 00:49:15,525
<i>The mass extinction we feared
has already begun.</i>

607
00:49:16,213 --> 00:49:18,370
<i>And we are the cause.</i>

608
00:49:19,362 --> 00:49:21,518
<i>We are the infection.</i>

609
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,901
<i>But like all living organisms,</i>

610
00:49:23,926 --> 00:49:27,371
<i>the Earth unleashed a fever
to fight this infection.</i>

611
00:49:27,457 --> 00:49:30,941
<i>Its original and rightful rulers.</i>

612
00:49:31,324 --> 00:49:32,668
<i>The Titans.</i>

613
00:49:33,082 --> 00:49:36,246
<i>They are part of the Earth's
natural defense system.</i>

614
00:49:36,496 --> 00:49:38,449
<i>A way to protect the planet,</i>

615
00:49:38,535 --> 00:49:40,371
<i>to maintain its balance.</i>

616
00:49:40,473 --> 00:49:43,660
<i>But if governments are
allowed to contain them,</i>

617
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:45,018
<i>destroy them,</i>

618
00:49:45,043 --> 00:49:46,785
<i>or use them for war,</i>

619
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:49,668
<i>the human infection will
only continue to spread.</i>

620
00:49:49,746 --> 00:49:51,855
<i>And within our lifetime,</i>

621
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:54,816
<i>our planet will perish.</i>

622
00:49:55,895 --> 00:49:57,355
<i>And so will we.</i>

623
00:49:57,777 --> 00:50:00,652
Unless we restore balance.

624
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:03,066
<i>And what's gonna be left
if you do this?</i>

625
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:06,590
<i>A dead, charred world
overrun by monsters?</i>

626
00:50:06,615 --> 00:50:09,520
<i>No, Dr. Stanton,
the exact opposite.</i>

627
00:50:09,637 --> 00:50:12,721
<i>Just like how a forest fire
replenishes the soil,</i>

628
00:50:12,746 --> 00:50:15,395
<i>or how a volcano
creates new land.</i>

629
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,363
<i>We have seen signs that these
creatures will do the same.</i>

630
00:50:18,465 --> 00:50:22,010
<i>San Francisco, Las Vegas,
wherever the Titans go,</i>

631
00:50:22,035 --> 00:50:23,355
<i>life follows.</i>

632
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,351
<i>Triggered by their radiation.</i>

633
00:50:25,376 --> 00:50:26,945
<i>They are the only thing</i>

634
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,039
<i>that can reverse the
destruction that we started.</i>

635
00:50:29,064 --> 00:50:33,461
<i>They are the only guarantee
that life will carry on.</i>

636
00:50:33,594 --> 00:50:35,250
<i>But for that to happen,</i>

637
00:50:35,275 --> 00:50:36,524
<i>we must set them free.</i>

638
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:38,257
You are murdering the world.

639
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:39,287
<i>No.</i>

640
00:50:39,312 --> 00:50:41,836
<i>Because as difficult
as this will be,</i>

641
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:45,070
<i>I promise,
humanity will not go extinct.</i>

642
00:50:45,124 --> 00:50:48,742
<i>Using the Orca, we will
return to a natural order.</i>

643
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:50,366
<i>A forgotten order</i>

644
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:53,797
<i>where we coexisted in
balance with the Titans.</i>

645
00:50:54,048 --> 00:50:55,445
<i>The first gods.</i>

646
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,564
This is a dangerous path.

647
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:01,639
You are meddling with forces
beyond our comprehension.

648
00:51:01,664 --> 00:51:03,448
Gambling with the
lives of billions!

649
00:51:03,473 --> 00:51:05,608
<i>And what are you
gambling with, Serizawa?</i>

650
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:07,139
<i>Monarch is broken.</i>

651
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,741
<i>It's on the verge of being
shut down by a government</i>

652
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:12,279
<i>whose only objective is to
eradicate the creatures.</i>

653
00:51:12,304 --> 00:51:13,648
<i>And if that happens,</i>

654
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:14,967
<i>what will our chances be?</i>

655
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:16,962
You are outta your
goddamn mind!

656
00:51:17,104 --> 00:51:18,604
<i>First, you put our
daughter's life in danger.</i>

657
00:51:18,629 --> 00:51:21,058
<i>Now, you get to decide the fate
of the world. That's rich, Emma.</i>

658
00:51:21,127 --> 00:51:23,064
<i>I couldn't be more sane...</i>

659
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:25,089
<i>and Madison couldn't
be stronger.</i>

660
00:51:25,308 --> 00:51:28,589
<i>After we lost Andrew,
I trained her to survive.</i>

661
00:51:28,614 --> 00:51:30,893
<i>And at least now,
she will have a fighting chance.</i>

662
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:33,768
A fighting chance...
Why don't you listen to yourself?

663
00:51:33,793 --> 00:51:35,550
<i>It's not all math, Emma.</i>

664
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:37,118
<i>Some things you can't control.</i>

665
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:40,002
<i>And there are some things
that you can't run from!</i>

666
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,854
This won't bring him back to us.

667
00:51:58,427 --> 00:52:00,623
<i>I can only urge you all
to take refuge.</i>

668
00:52:02,055 --> 00:52:05,000
<i>Over the last 60 years,
Monarch has prepared bunkers</i>

669
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,250
<i>around the world to save
and restart civilization.</i>

670
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,934
This won't bring him back to us.

671
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:28,012
<i>I can only urge you all
to take refuge.</i>

672
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,846
<i>Over the last 60 years,
Monarch has prepared bunkers</i>

673
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:35,739
<i>around the world to save
and restart civilization.</i>

674
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:37,887
<i>I suggest you find them.</i>

675
00:52:45,544 --> 00:52:46,849
That bitch.

676
00:52:47,145 --> 00:52:49,207
How long till this thing lands?

677
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:50,643
Three minutes.

678
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,307
- You might wanna rethink that.
- Why?

679
00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:55,582
Somethin's not right.
Check this out.

680
00:52:55,856 --> 00:52:57,737
Emma's not at Isla de Mara.

681
00:52:57,762 --> 00:53:00,427
I mean, the signal's too
weak to be local, she's...

682
00:53:00,452 --> 00:53:02,334
bouncing it off our satellites.

683
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:04,677
They must be holed up in
one of our old bunkers.

684
00:53:04,702 --> 00:53:06,396
She could be anywhere.

685
00:53:07,302 --> 00:53:08,420
What is that?

686
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:12,888
Oh, Jesus. She shut down
the containment system.

687
00:53:12,913 --> 00:53:14,693
How much time do we have?

688
00:53:15,896 --> 00:53:18,230
Containment system bypassed.
We're patched in.

689
00:53:18,255 --> 00:53:20,115
Ready to broadcast the Orca.

690
00:53:22,013 --> 00:53:23,326
Doctor?

691
00:53:37,263 --> 00:53:38,623
Mom, don't!

692
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:41,318
I'm sorry, did a child
just tell you what to do?

693
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,123
Maybe Dad is right.
Maybe this isn't the way.

694
00:53:43,148 --> 00:53:46,498
By all means, Dr. Russell,
let's reconsider our entire plan.

695
00:53:46,545 --> 00:53:48,912
Especially after telling
all your friends about it.

696
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:50,148
Madison, we talked about this.

697
00:53:50,194 --> 00:53:51,717
No, you said you were
gonna help people.

698
00:53:51,742 --> 00:53:52,913
that you would let them...

699
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:55,171
We don't have time for this!

700
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:59,005
Did you really think this
was gonna be easy, painless?

701
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,132
Is that what you told her?

702
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:01,366
- Leave her out of this.
- Why?

703
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:03,179
You're the one who
pulled her into it.

704
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:07,093
Madison, tell me,
what exactly did Mommy sell you on?

705
00:54:07,148 --> 00:54:08,866
Some grand utopia?

706
00:54:08,905 --> 00:54:12,005
Man and monster living
together in blissful harmony?

707
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:14,320
Sir, they're attempting
to lock us out.

708
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:15,678
It's now or never.

709
00:54:15,757 --> 00:54:18,273
Emma, you came to me.

710
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:20,601
This is your plan.

711
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:22,030
We both want to save the planet,

712
00:54:22,116 --> 00:54:23,966
but everything is going to die

713
00:54:23,991 --> 00:54:25,937
if we don't see it through.

714
00:54:25,984 --> 00:54:27,163
Please.

715
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:29,585
At least let them get to safety.

716
00:54:31,194 --> 00:54:34,195
Ma'am, our window's closing.

717
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,188
Mom.

718
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,056
I'm sorry, Madison.

719
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:43,845
This is bigger than
just you and me.

720
00:54:44,127 --> 00:54:47,939
Isla de Mara, Mexico
Monarch Outpost 56

721
00:55:58,283 --> 00:56:00,408
You got a catchy
name for this one?

722
00:56:00,752 --> 00:56:02,533
Local legends call it

723
00:56:02,558 --> 00:56:03,885
Rodan.

724
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:05,432
The Fire Demon.

725
00:56:05,457 --> 00:56:06,947
That's comforting.

726
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:08,939
Guys...

727
00:56:08,964 --> 00:56:11,861
Remember that tropical storm
where we lost Monster Zero?

728
00:56:12,197 --> 00:56:14,471
It's changing direction and, uh,

729
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,283
guess where it's headed now.

730
00:56:16,346 --> 00:56:17,969
That's not possible.

731
00:56:17,994 --> 00:56:19,799
No storm moves that fast.

732
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,002
Unless it's not a storm.

733
00:56:24,492 --> 00:56:25,492
Oh, man.

734
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:27,548
We need time to
finish the evacuation.

735
00:56:27,573 --> 00:56:29,970
Then you better hurry
'cause it's closin' in fast.

736
00:56:30,103 --> 00:56:31,390
Serizawa.

737
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:34,228
It's not a coincidence that
Monster Zero thing is headed here.

738
00:56:34,274 --> 00:56:36,118
It's reacting to
Big Bird's cries.

739
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,969
That means it's coming
for food or fight or...

740
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:40,478
something more intimate.

741
00:56:40,517 --> 00:56:42,040
What do you suggest?

742
00:56:44,353 --> 00:56:46,853
<i>All fighters, weapons free.</i>

743
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:11,821
Oh, I think we got his attention.

744
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,203
Everyone strap in.

745
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:15,649
All ships, follow our lead.

746
00:57:54,742 --> 00:57:56,093
It's gonna be okay!

747
00:57:56,679 --> 00:57:58,070
Hang on, kid!

748
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:15,867
Argo to Gold Squadron,

749
00:58:15,921 --> 00:58:18,233
Let's lure this turkey
away from the mainland

750
00:58:18,258 --> 00:58:20,969
straight to Monster Zero.
ETA, two minutes.

751
00:58:20,994 --> 00:58:22,492
Gold Squadron,
engage on our six.

752
00:58:22,517 --> 00:58:24,102
<i>Copy. Start the clock.</i>

753
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:44,289
<i>Bogey. 9 o'clock, hot.</i>

754
00:58:51,601 --> 00:58:53,132
Raptor 223, get outta there.

755
00:58:53,157 --> 00:58:54,999
<i>He's on your tail,
get outta there!</i>

756
00:59:03,211 --> 00:59:05,304
Cobra's Raptor is off the team.

757
00:59:05,329 --> 00:59:08,127
ETA to Monster Zero, 60 seconds!

758
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,825
<i>Raptor 27,
bogey coming up on your six.</i>

759
00:59:24,507 --> 00:59:27,804
I'm losing control here!
I'm losing control...!

760
00:59:32,289 --> 00:59:33,777
We've lost the squadron.

761
00:59:33,802 --> 00:59:36,333
ETA to Monster Zero, 30 seconds!

762
00:59:54,196 --> 00:59:55,610
Ten seconds!

763
01:00:16,587 --> 01:00:17,814
Dive!

764
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:19,424
Dive!

765
01:00:43,303 --> 01:00:44,568
Jesus, they're killin' each other.

766
01:00:44,593 --> 01:00:46,420
<i>Mayday mayday,
this is Raptor One to Argo.</i>

767
01:00:46,482 --> 01:00:47,691
<i>Argo, do you read?</i>

768
01:00:47,716 --> 01:00:49,708
Copy, Raptor One.
What's your status?

769
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:51,177
<i>We're screwed, that's what.</i>

770
01:00:51,224 --> 01:00:52,794
<i>And we got kids on board.</i>

771
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,318
We're gonna need immediate
mid-air retrieval.

772
01:00:54,343 --> 01:00:55,958
Lock on to their position
and prepare the hangar

773
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:57,231
for an emergency landing.

774
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,090
Hangar doors are unresponsive.

775
01:00:59,115 --> 01:01:00,138
Manual override?

776
01:01:00,163 --> 01:01:01,380
They're stuck!

777
01:01:03,099 --> 01:01:04,334
Alright, which way
to the hangar?

778
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:05,537
I can show you.

779
01:01:05,562 --> 01:01:07,060
Anybody else?

780
01:01:07,279 --> 01:01:08,652
I know the way, I...

781
01:01:08,677 --> 01:01:09,699
Come on!

782
01:01:09,724 --> 01:01:10,990
I hope you got a big wrench.

783
01:01:20,535 --> 01:01:21,761
What's the problem?

784
01:01:21,948 --> 01:01:23,629
Hydraulic systems are jammed.

785
01:01:23,654 --> 01:01:25,402
I'm trying to
jump start power.

786
01:01:25,456 --> 01:01:26,980
It's not looking good.

787
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:37,585
It's Admiral Stenz.

788
01:01:38,342 --> 01:01:39,397
Admiral.

789
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,061
<i>Dr. Serizawa, Col. Foster,</i>

790
01:01:41,123 --> 01:01:43,036
<i>I need you and your
forces to immediately</i>

791
01:01:43,092 --> 01:01:45,600
<i>disengage and withdraw
to a safe distance.</i>

792
01:01:45,638 --> 01:01:47,232
Admiral, I don't understand.

793
01:01:47,257 --> 01:01:50,780
<i>We have been developing a
prototype for a new weapon.</i>

794
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:53,217
<i>An Oxygen Destroyer.</i>

795
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:57,360
<i>Designed to exterminate all
life forms within a two-mile radius.</i>

796
01:01:57,743 --> 01:01:59,587
<i>With any luck,
it will kill these things</i>

797
01:01:59,612 --> 01:02:01,518
<i>and this nightmare
will finally be over.</i>

798
01:02:01,543 --> 01:02:04,014
Admiral, we must keep
our faith in Godzilla.

799
01:02:04,056 --> 01:02:06,165
<i>I'm sorry, Doctor,
you had your chance.</i>

800
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,092
<i>The missile is already on its way.</i>

801
01:02:08,397 --> 01:02:10,342
<i>May God have mercy on us all.</i>

802
01:02:14,192 --> 01:02:16,278
He's not lying.
It's coming in hot.

803
01:02:17,591 --> 01:02:19,692
<i>Argo, you gotta get this
'Sprey to a good wing now!</i>

804
01:02:19,811 --> 01:02:21,583
Have the crash and
fire crews ready!

805
01:02:27,648 --> 01:02:29,844
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

806
01:02:32,966 --> 01:02:34,161
Look out!

807
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:40,670
Hold on!

808
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:44,102
Come on, Griff!

809
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:46,391
Head in!

810
01:02:46,727 --> 01:02:47,836
Head in!

811
01:03:04,728 --> 01:03:06,298
That's what I'm talkin'
about, Griff!

812
01:03:06,736 --> 01:03:07,845
Everybody okay?

813
01:03:09,779 --> 01:03:11,053
Get on to the back.

814
01:03:12,861 --> 01:03:14,346
Yo, thanks for the lift!

815
01:03:19,974 --> 01:03:21,177
Oh, God.

816
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:47,956
We're gettin' outta here.

817
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:49,526
Military launched a weapon.

818
01:03:49,604 --> 01:03:50,878
It's gonna kill 'em both.

819
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,699
Well, that's not the worst idea.

820
01:04:00,471 --> 01:04:01,697
Ten.

821
01:04:02,276 --> 01:04:03,471
Nine.

822
01:04:04,158 --> 01:04:05,580
Eight.

823
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:07,229
Seven.

824
01:04:18,549 --> 01:04:19,556
Three.

825
01:04:20,134 --> 01:04:21,181
Two.

826
01:05:06,143 --> 01:05:07,370
Jesus.

827
01:05:07,893 --> 01:05:11,245
Dr. Stanton,
can you locate Godzilla?

828
01:05:14,515 --> 01:05:16,585
Yeah, I got somethin'.

829
01:05:18,132 --> 01:05:19,811
His vitals are fading.

830
01:05:20,647 --> 01:05:22,718
Radiation levels are plummeting.

831
01:05:24,998 --> 01:05:26,796
Come on, big guy, fight it.

832
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:38,303
He's gone.

833
01:05:41,663 --> 01:05:43,929
Looks like
you got your wish, Mark.

834
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:33,962
Monarch Outpost 55
Sedona, Arizona

835
01:06:44,705 --> 01:06:48,166
Monarch Outpost 67
Munich, Germany

836
01:07:09,328 --> 01:07:12,109
I thought we were going to
release them gradually.

837
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,367
One at a time.

838
01:07:15,538 --> 01:07:17,515
I'm not the one doing this.

839
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:25,327
Long live the king.

840
01:07:37,197 --> 01:07:38,447
You're a monster.

841
01:07:49,384 --> 01:07:51,336
Mothra Cocoon Site
Yunnan Rainforest, China

842
01:07:51,361 --> 01:07:54,199
<i>Castle Bravo, this is containment
team Mosura. Do you read? Over.</i>

843
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,964
- Castle Bravo, this is...
- Anything?

844
01:07:57,175 --> 01:08:00,128
Dr. Brooks. We've lost
contact with the Argo.

845
01:08:00,268 --> 01:08:02,472
Castle Bravo and the
other containment sites.

846
01:08:02,651 --> 01:08:05,308
Angkor Wat, Skull Island,
Stone Mountain.

847
01:08:05,401 --> 01:08:06,534
All the Titans.

848
01:08:06,706 --> 01:08:08,433
They're escaping.

849
01:08:12,363 --> 01:08:13,588
Wait, wait, wait.

850
01:08:14,378 --> 01:08:15,831
It's-It's him.

851
01:08:16,104 --> 01:08:17,995
He's the one doing this.

852
01:08:18,089 --> 01:08:20,526
They're responding to his call.

853
01:08:23,409 --> 01:08:24,675
Where's Dr. Ling?

854
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:26,737
She's outside.

855
01:08:28,526 --> 01:08:29,768
Dr. Ling!

856
01:08:29,862 --> 01:08:31,995
We've lost contact with Monarch.

857
01:08:34,093 --> 01:08:35,429
Dr. Ling?

858
01:09:46,596 --> 01:09:48,276
- Madison, wait.
- Get away from me.

859
01:09:48,339 --> 01:09:51,245
Look, I know things haven't gone
exactly according to plan, but

860
01:09:51,323 --> 01:09:53,331
- I can fix this.
- "According to plan"?

861
01:09:53,358 --> 01:09:54,600
You said that you
were gonna be careful,

862
01:09:54,639 --> 01:09:56,083
that you'd release
them one at a time,

863
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:57,264
that you would restore balance.

864
01:09:57,289 --> 01:09:59,637
They were gonna take over
Monarch and kill the Titans.

865
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:00,661
I didn't have a choice.

866
01:10:00,686 --> 01:10:01,889
Bullshit.

867
01:10:05,873 --> 01:10:09,123
You said we were
doing this for Andrew.

868
01:10:13,686 --> 01:10:16,241
Do you really think he
would have wanted this?

869
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:24,760
Exactly.

870
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:31,058
Madison.

871
01:10:33,737 --> 01:10:34,800
Madison.

872
01:10:48,086 --> 01:10:49,250
Any luck?

873
01:10:50,423 --> 01:10:51,532
No.

874
01:10:52,516 --> 01:10:53,759
Whatever

875
01:10:53,789 --> 01:10:56,867
Emma used to create the Orca
signal, I've never heard it.

876
01:10:57,163 --> 01:10:58,413
How are you doing?

877
01:11:00,444 --> 01:11:01,562
How's that?

878
01:11:01,587 --> 01:11:03,296
Make this our compass.

879
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,301
It's something
my mom used to say.

880
01:11:06,348 --> 01:11:09,598
She believed our stories
about monsters and dragons

881
01:11:09,623 --> 01:11:11,270
could help us find the Titans

882
01:11:11,325 --> 01:11:13,854
and restore our
connection to nature.

883
01:11:13,879 --> 01:11:14,904
Wait, your mother?

884
01:11:14,929 --> 01:11:16,890
You're second
generation Monarch?

885
01:11:16,915 --> 01:11:17,931
Third.

886
01:11:18,512 --> 01:11:20,544
It runs in the family.

887
01:11:21,012 --> 01:11:22,395
That's incredible!

888
01:11:22,423 --> 01:11:25,213
I don't suppose your family has any
tips on slaying dragons, do they?

889
01:11:25,238 --> 01:11:28,098
Slaying dragons is
a Western concept.

890
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:31,458
In the East, they are
sacred, divine creatures

891
01:11:31,483 --> 01:11:34,202
who brought wisdom, strength,

892
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,640
even redemption.

893
01:11:38,352 --> 01:11:39,977
This Oxygen Destroyer...

894
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:42,250
Why wasn't
Monster Zero affected?

895
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:44,367
I mean, I'm no scientist but I
think it had something to do with

896
01:11:44,392 --> 01:11:46,086
 his goddamn head growing back.

897
01:11:46,111 --> 01:11:47,664
I never seen anything like it.

898
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:50,619
Violates everything we know
about the natural order.

899
01:11:50,692 --> 01:11:53,200
Unless he's not
part of the natural order.

900
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:54,598
What do you mean?

901
01:11:54,653 --> 01:11:56,637
I was able to piece this together.

902
01:11:58,715 --> 01:12:01,317
Well, he looks vaguely familiar.

903
01:12:01,379 --> 01:12:04,419
It tells of a great dragon
who fell from the stars.

904
01:12:04,804 --> 01:12:09,140
A Hydra whose storms swallowed
both men and gods alike.

905
01:12:09,218 --> 01:12:10,474
You mean an alien?

906
01:12:10,499 --> 01:12:13,257
Yes. He's not part
of our natural order.

907
01:12:13,282 --> 01:12:15,272
And he's not meant to be here.

908
01:12:15,381 --> 01:12:16,770
A false king.

909
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:18,561
The invasive species.

910
01:12:18,647 --> 01:12:21,356
That could explain how he's
creating these massive storms

911
01:12:21,381 --> 01:12:23,490
and the effect he's having
on the other Titans.

912
01:12:23,584 --> 01:12:26,395
It's almost like he's reshaping
the planet to his own liking.

913
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,842
These legends,
what did they call him?

914
01:12:29,084 --> 01:12:30,444
Ghidorah.

915
01:12:30,483 --> 01:12:32,553
The One Who is Many.

916
01:12:32,787 --> 01:12:35,395
- Gi-what?
- She seriously say gonorrhea?

917
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,490
Ghidorah!

918
01:12:36,608 --> 01:12:37,951
Dr. Serizawa,

919
01:12:38,029 --> 01:12:39,903
we're approaching
Castle Bravo, but

920
01:12:39,928 --> 01:12:41,623
there's something you should see.

921
01:12:45,787 --> 01:12:48,342
I'm guessing you weren't
expecting these guys.

922
01:12:50,029 --> 01:12:53,936
Moscow, London,
Washington D.C.

923
01:12:54,053 --> 01:12:55,920
All under attack.

924
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:59,247
On every continent, the Titans
are triggering earthquakes,

925
01:12:59,272 --> 01:13:01,334
wildfires, tsunamis

926
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:04,311
and disasters we don't
even have names for yet.

927
01:13:04,776 --> 01:13:06,012
Now, as before,

928
01:13:06,037 --> 01:13:08,887
we have been trying to lure the
creatures with nuclear materials,

929
01:13:08,912 --> 01:13:11,186
but they are not taking
the bait this time.

930
01:13:11,581 --> 01:13:15,284
Their behavior has become
random, erratic.

931
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:18,159
And with our forces
spread desperately thin

932
01:13:18,184 --> 01:13:21,267
and these things roaming
the globe unimpeded,

933
01:13:21,323 --> 01:13:23,409
we are running out of options

934
01:13:23,463 --> 01:13:24,729
and time.

935
01:13:25,089 --> 01:13:26,839
Excuse me, do you
have something to add?

936
01:13:27,378 --> 01:13:28,517
Yeah.

937
01:13:28,542 --> 01:13:29,769
You're wrong.

938
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:33,034
Their behavior is not random
or erratic.

939
01:13:33,355 --> 01:13:34,581
If I may, sir?

940
01:13:34,636 --> 01:13:36,394
As amazing as this sounds,

941
01:13:36,503 --> 01:13:38,003
they're moving like a pack.

942
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:39,222
They're hunting.

943
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:42,558
All packs, from wolves
to killer whales,

944
01:13:42,612 --> 01:13:45,487
they all respond
directly to an alpha.

945
01:13:45,512 --> 01:13:47,245
And this Ghidorah is
the new alpha and all

946
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,479
all the other creatures
are just doing his bidding.

947
01:13:49,504 --> 01:13:51,683
They're-They're
an extension of him.

948
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,044
We stop him...

949
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:55,403
we stop them all.

950
01:13:55,607 --> 01:13:58,528
Is there another creature that
might stand a chance against him?

951
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,661
No.

952
01:13:59,688 --> 01:14:03,337
Ghidorah and Godzilla's rivalry
was ancient and unique.

953
01:14:03,362 --> 01:14:07,368
Right, so we killed our best
shot at beating this thing?

954
01:14:07,838 --> 01:14:10,588
<i>Jonah, you don't get it.
This changes everything.</i>

955
01:14:10,627 --> 01:14:12,547
<i>With Godzilla gone,
Monster Zero isn't</i>

956
01:14:12,572 --> 01:14:14,900
using the Titans to
restore the planet.

957
01:14:14,978 --> 01:14:17,150
He is using them to destroy it.

958
01:14:17,273 --> 01:14:20,038
This isn't coexistence.
This is extinction.

959
01:14:20,133 --> 01:14:23,570
Listen, while you were sitting
comfortably in some laboratory,

960
01:14:23,664 --> 01:14:27,765
we've been fighting for decades
in one dirty war after another.

961
01:14:27,812 --> 01:14:29,592
I've seen human
nature firsthand,

962
01:14:29,617 --> 01:14:32,125
and I'm here to tell you
that it doesn't get any better.

963
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,031
It just gets worse.

964
01:14:34,062 --> 01:14:35,890
So I'm sorry that Monster Zero

965
01:14:35,915 --> 01:14:38,523
isn't exactly what
we were expecting.

966
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,718
But we opened Pandora's Box.

967
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:44,327
And there's no closing it now.

968
01:14:46,883 --> 01:14:48,102
Maybe there is.

969
01:14:48,133 --> 01:14:49,414
Oh, don't be stupid.

970
01:14:49,454 --> 01:14:51,094
You broadcast again

971
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,102
and you will expose us all.

972
01:14:53,135 --> 01:14:55,062
These creatures communicate
like whales, okay?

973
01:14:55,087 --> 01:14:58,508
<i>They can hear sonar for
thousands of miles, so...</i>

974
01:14:58,854 --> 01:15:00,360
<i>Let's send a team,</i>

975
01:15:00,385 --> 01:15:02,407
<i>let's broadcast the
Orca from Fenway.</i>

976
01:15:02,432 --> 01:15:04,018
<i>It's just a few miles from here.</i>

977
01:15:04,236 --> 01:15:06,517
I could use the stadium
to amplify a signal

978
01:15:06,542 --> 01:15:08,518
that might stop these attacks.

979
01:15:08,596 --> 01:15:10,072
<i>The city's already
being evacuated,</i>

980
01:15:10,097 --> 01:15:11,299
<i>so we'll be safe.</i>

981
01:15:11,379 --> 01:15:12,903
<i>- And then what?
- I don't know.</i>

982
01:15:12,928 --> 01:15:14,890
<i>Figure out what the hell
Monster Zero really is</i>

983
01:15:14,915 --> 01:15:16,453
<i>and try to stop it.</i>

984
01:15:16,509 --> 01:15:17,945
<i>Before Monarch finds us.</i>

985
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,906
<i>I'm sure your old friends will
be very happy to see you again.</i>

986
01:15:20,931 --> 01:15:23,158
<i>We can't just sit here, all right?</i>

987
01:15:23,183 --> 01:15:24,671
<i>This isn't the world
that we wanted.</i>

988
01:15:24,726 --> 01:15:26,400
<i>I seem to remember
you telling me</i>

989
01:15:26,425 --> 01:15:29,789
<i>that the world always
belonged to them.</i>

990
01:15:30,085 --> 01:15:32,804
<i>Maybe it is time
we gave it back.</i>

991
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:37,107
Mark!

992
01:15:37,982 --> 01:15:40,021
Mark, wait.
What are you doing?

993
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:43,240
I can't just sit down there.
I gotta do something.

994
01:15:43,265 --> 01:15:45,506
- Like what?
- Like go find my daughter.

995
01:15:45,622 --> 01:15:46,723
H-How?

996
01:15:46,748 --> 01:15:48,084
Where are you gonna go?

997
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:52,294
She's the only thing
I got left, Sam.

998
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:55,664
I'm what she's there for.

999
01:15:55,725 --> 01:15:57,554
Not gonna let that happen again.

1000
01:15:59,832 --> 01:16:00,989
Good luck.

1001
01:17:12,873 --> 01:17:14,327
Beautiful.

1002
01:17:16,155 --> 01:17:17,256
Mothra.

1003
01:17:17,281 --> 01:17:19,373
Queen of the Monsters.

1004
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:22,693
Are you recording this, Stanton?

1005
01:17:25,061 --> 01:17:26,654
I record everything, man.

1006
01:17:28,197 --> 01:17:29,376
Everything.

1007
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:33,431
It's like a song.

1008
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:36,884
I bet there's only one thing
that can understand this.

1009
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:39,853
Godzilla.

1010
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:46,137
Yeah, I got it.

1011
01:17:46,215 --> 01:17:48,394
Pickin' up the reply.
Bringing it up.

1012
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:55,199
He's still alive.

1013
01:17:57,933 --> 01:18:01,699
So, her and...
Godzilla, they, like...

1014
01:18:01,724 --> 01:18:03,254
they got a thing goin' on?

1015
01:18:03,293 --> 01:18:04,565
That's kinda messed up, right?

1016
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:07,980
Symbiotic relationships
between two different species

1017
01:18:08,066 --> 01:18:10,301
aren’t all that uncommon.

1018
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:12,215
Can you track him?

1019
01:18:12,246 --> 01:18:14,387
No. Signal's too weak.

1020
01:18:16,777 --> 01:18:18,488
But maybe she can.

1021
01:18:22,535 --> 01:18:24,207
How many nukes do you have?

1022
01:18:25,137 --> 01:18:26,269
Why?

1023
01:18:27,058 --> 01:18:28,426
We could help him.

1024
01:18:34,691 --> 01:18:37,059
This Category 6
hurricane over D.C.

1025
01:18:37,084 --> 01:18:39,197
is where King Ghidorah is nesting.

1026
01:18:39,222 --> 01:18:41,000
Working with all four
branches of the military,

1027
01:18:41,025 --> 01:18:43,102
this will be a joint operation.

1028
01:18:43,127 --> 01:18:45,314
To lure it away
from the mainland

1029
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:47,321
<i>so that we can
continue evacuations.</i>

1030
01:18:47,346 --> 01:18:50,799
<i>Long enough for our submersible
team to complete its mission.</i>

1031
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:58,268
So this plan is what you
call a long shot, right?

1032
01:18:58,293 --> 01:18:59,487
What do those nerds
think they're gonna do

1033
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,244
down there with
a bunch of nukes?

1034
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:02,792
You didn't hear 'em, Griffin?

1035
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:05,089
They wanna bring Godzilla
back from the dead.

1036
01:19:13,112 --> 01:19:14,674
You'll be out of range
while you're down there

1037
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:17,347
but a squadron will stay behind
to keep an eye out for you.

1038
01:19:17,394 --> 01:19:18,613
<i>Appreciate it.</i>

1039
01:19:18,638 --> 01:19:20,864
Alrighty, Bowman.
Let's take her down.

1040
01:19:20,959 --> 01:19:24,057
Dive the ship.
Make depth 150.

1041
01:19:24,144 --> 01:19:25,278
Good luck.

1042
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:26,537
<i>Thanks, Sam.</i>

1043
01:19:27,325 --> 01:19:28,474
<i>We'll need it.</i>

1044
01:19:54,094 --> 01:19:55,235
What time is it?

1045
01:19:58,282 --> 01:20:00,055
Time to get a new watch.

1046
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,593
Andrew's favorite joke.

1047
01:20:05,054 --> 01:20:06,718
You never took that
watch out of your pocket

1048
01:20:06,743 --> 01:20:09,023
without him asking
that question.

1049
01:20:12,756 --> 01:20:14,983
If you told me five years ago

1050
01:20:16,092 --> 01:20:18,951
I'd be trying to save the
thing that took my son,

1051
01:20:20,108 --> 01:20:22,497
or it would be the only way to
save the family I loved, I'd...

1052
01:20:22,522 --> 01:20:24,045
Sometimes,

1053
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:28,217
the only way to heal our
wounds is to make peace

1054
01:20:28,242 --> 01:20:30,717
with the demons
who created them.

1055
01:20:31,196 --> 01:20:32,579
You really believe that?

1056
01:20:32,805 --> 01:20:34,157
Don't you?

1057
01:20:35,234 --> 01:20:37,133
Isn't that why you are here?

1058
01:20:40,274 --> 01:20:43,227
There are some things beyond
our understanding, Mark.

1059
01:20:44,595 --> 01:20:47,774
We must accept them
and learn from them.

1060
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:50,078
Because these moments of crisis

1061
01:20:50,103 --> 01:20:52,383
are also potential
moments of faith.

1062
01:20:54,273 --> 01:20:58,523
A time, when we either
come together or fall apart.

1063
01:21:00,508 --> 01:21:03,610
Nature always has a way
of balancing itself.

1064
01:21:05,745 --> 01:21:07,753
The only question is,

1065
01:21:09,377 --> 01:21:10,907
what part

1066
01:21:11,546 --> 01:21:13,267
will we play?

1067
01:21:14,054 --> 01:21:15,791
Did you just make that up?

1068
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,107
No.

1069
01:21:17,132 --> 01:21:19,439
I read it in a
fortune cookie once.

1070
01:21:21,716 --> 01:21:23,693
A really long fortune cookie.

1071
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:29,908
Status on the ship?

1072
01:21:29,933 --> 01:21:32,229
Some sort of vortex got us,
it's dragging us.

1073
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:34,018
1,600 feet till impact.

1074
01:21:39,611 --> 01:21:40,908
800 feet!

1075
01:21:41,054 --> 01:21:43,118
Emergency close, 200 feet.

1076
01:21:43,323 --> 01:21:44,424
100!

1077
01:21:44,651 --> 01:21:45,876
25!

1078
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:47,940
Brace for impact!

1079
01:22:58,418 --> 01:23:01,739
Boston

1080
01:23:05,324 --> 01:23:08,793
<i>Admiral, this is USS Brody
en route to evacuation perimeter</i>

1081
01:23:08,902 --> 01:23:12,527
<i>Weapons hot, ready to engage
Titans on your command.</i>

1082
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,347
Jesus.

1083
01:23:15,605 --> 01:23:17,871
It's like the whole sky's alive.

1084
01:23:19,675 --> 01:23:21,355
That's because it is.

1085
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:24,980
Here we go.

1086
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,417
Status report.

1087
01:23:30,519 --> 01:23:32,456
Can't fix our
position, GPS is down.

1088
01:23:32,504 --> 01:23:36,339
But inertial says we're at...
600 miles from departure.

1089
01:23:36,364 --> 01:23:37,558
That can't be.

1090
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:39,035
I knew it, man!

1091
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:42,355
The vortex was a tunnel
into the hollow Earth.

1092
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:43,730
It's a subterranean...

1093
01:23:43,755 --> 01:23:46,038
tunnel system that-that
connects the entire planet.

1094
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:48,582
Doesn't matter. I knew I
was right. I told you, Chen!

1095
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:50,014
Shut up, Rick.

1096
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,264
We'll take an emergency
pull forward.

1097
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:03,007
Doctor?

1098
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:05,500
Launch probes.

1099
01:24:19,242 --> 01:24:21,609
Range, 1,000 meters.

1100
01:24:22,133 --> 01:24:24,148
Camera, good.

1101
01:24:25,469 --> 01:24:27,102
Holding in range.

1102
01:24:27,413 --> 01:24:28,710
Steady.

1103
01:24:32,928 --> 01:24:34,178
Jesus.

1104
01:24:34,483 --> 01:24:36,170
Pan right.

1105
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,077
Looks Egyptian.

1106
01:25:02,217 --> 01:25:03,608
- Or Roman.
- No.

1107
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:06,139
This is somethin' different.
This is...

1108
01:25:06,264 --> 01:25:07,874
This is way older.

1109
01:25:17,068 --> 01:25:18,241
Oh, my.

1110
01:25:28,902 --> 01:25:30,574
All the legends.

1111
01:25:31,191 --> 01:25:32,629
The stories.

1112
01:25:33,074 --> 01:25:34,410
They're true.

1113
01:25:34,566 --> 01:25:36,863
They really were the first gods.

1114
01:25:36,888 --> 01:25:40,613
If only the Earth and stones could
speak, the stories they could tell us.

1115
01:25:40,863 --> 01:25:43,683
Dr. Stanton,
any sign of Godzilla?

1116
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:47,651
Yeah, the probe is picking
up a radioactive blob

1117
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:49,417
just past that ridge.

1118
01:25:50,676 --> 01:25:51,972
Set the course.

1119
01:26:00,123 --> 01:26:01,615
<i>Attention please.</i>

1120
01:26:01,716 --> 01:26:05,123
<i>Martial law is now instated
by order of the President.</i>

1121
01:26:05,466 --> 01:26:08,825
<i>The Greater Boston Area is now
under military supervision.</i>

1122
01:26:09,318 --> 01:26:12,576
<i>All citizens should report to
the nearest evacuation center</i>

1123
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:14,193
<i>for immediate transport.</i>

1124
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:15,566
<i>I repeat.</i>

1125
01:26:15,591 --> 01:26:18,675
<i>All citizens are to report
to the nearest evacuation...</i>

1126
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:21,379
<i>Massive storms and other
disasters triggered by the Titans</i>

1127
01:26:21,411 --> 01:26:23,940
<i>have forced millions
to flee major cities.</i>

1128
01:26:24,027 --> 01:26:27,151
<i>And with D.C. hit hard
by a Category 6 hurricane</i>

1129
01:26:27,176 --> 01:26:29,785
<i>that has left the capital
completely flooded,</i>

1130
01:26:29,831 --> 01:26:33,754
<i>this is the single greatest
disaster in human history.</i>

1131
01:26:33,816 --> 01:26:36,785
<i>The grim search continues
as people around the world</i>

1132
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:38,636
<i>sift through the
debris of leveled homes</i>

1133
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:40,902
<i>in the hope of finding
missing loved ones.</i>

1134
01:26:40,966 --> 01:26:42,652
<i>And though this sight
is heartbreaking,</i>

1135
01:26:42,677 --> 01:26:44,965
<i>it is unfortunately
nothing unique.</i>

1136
01:26:45,026 --> 01:26:47,440
<i>Cities around the glibe
have fallen under a wave</i>

1137
01:26:47,465 --> 01:26:49,033
<i>of what many are calling</i>

1138
01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:50,988
<i>"The Rise of the Titans".</i>

1139
01:26:56,568 --> 01:26:58,661
I think we should stop.

1140
01:26:58,756 --> 01:26:59,934
Why?

1141
01:26:59,959 --> 01:27:02,271
'Cause I still wanna
have kids one day.

1142
01:27:02,296 --> 01:27:04,709
Preferably without flippers.

1143
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,435
We'll stop, over the ship.

1144
01:27:18,955 --> 01:27:21,712
I got O2, CO2 and methane.

1145
01:27:21,759 --> 01:27:24,173
It looks there's some sort
of air pocket in there.

1146
01:27:36,906 --> 01:27:39,335
- My God...
- Zilla.

1147
01:27:40,835 --> 01:27:41,849
Ah, goodnight, Gracie.

1148
01:27:41,874 --> 01:27:43,312
Pull up the last frame.

1149
01:27:43,664 --> 01:27:46,172
There,
the source of the radiation.

1150
01:27:46,234 --> 01:27:47,937
That's why he returned here.

1151
01:27:48,086 --> 01:27:49,469
He's feeding.

1152
01:27:49,906 --> 01:27:51,250
Regenerating.

1153
01:27:52,587 --> 01:27:54,634
This is his home.

1154
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:58,509
This is how he
survived for so long.

1155
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,366
Always adapting.

1156
01:28:00,755 --> 01:28:01,968
Evolving.

1157
01:28:02,015 --> 01:28:03,194
It's incredible.

1158
01:28:03,242 --> 01:28:06,421
So, dude's got this
covered, right?

1159
01:28:06,476 --> 01:28:07,851
H-He just needs a little nap.

1160
01:28:07,876 --> 01:28:08,883
No.

1161
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,676
This process could take years.

1162
01:28:10,701 --> 01:28:12,466
We have to proceed as planned.

1163
01:28:12,491 --> 01:28:13,638
Hang on.

1164
01:28:13,685 --> 01:28:15,810
We're gonna launch
a nuclear torpedo

1165
01:28:15,835 --> 01:28:18,482
in order to revive
a giant monster.

1166
01:28:18,544 --> 01:28:21,927
Okay? This is-This is not like
we're just jump starting a car.

1167
01:28:21,952 --> 01:28:23,505
We have another complication.

1168
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:26,279
Our weapon systems were
damaged during the crash.

1169
01:28:26,388 --> 01:28:28,779
- We can't launch.
- Can it be repaired?

1170
01:28:28,935 --> 01:28:30,076
I'm afraid not.

1171
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:33,943
Okay. What if we go inside,
set a timer,

1172
01:28:33,998 --> 01:28:35,841
and blow up the
warhead manually?

1173
01:28:35,904 --> 01:28:39,927
No way. If the heat doesn't
fry you, the radiation will.

1174
01:28:43,044 --> 01:28:44,098
I'll go.

1175
01:28:44,684 --> 01:28:46,176
What the hell does that mean?

1176
01:28:46,426 --> 01:28:47,815
There must be another way.

1177
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,380
There's no time for debate.

1178
01:28:50,778 --> 01:28:51,840
I'll go.

1179
01:29:10,584 --> 01:29:13,012
Argo! We are red on
ammo and low on fuel!

1180
01:29:13,037 --> 01:29:14,145
<i>We can't take much more of this!</i>

1181
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:15,177
Copy. Copy.

1182
01:29:15,202 --> 01:29:16,849
Just hold them off
as long as you can!

1183
01:29:16,874 --> 01:29:17,997
Colonel, take a look at this.

1184
01:29:18,022 --> 01:29:19,242
All the Titans have stopped.

1185
01:29:24,758 --> 01:29:26,782
What the hell's
gotten into them now?

1186
01:29:32,961 --> 01:29:36,852
<i>It does appear as if the attacks
have ceased for the time being.</i>

1187
01:29:36,923 --> 01:29:40,837
<i>With the creatures going from
destructive to docile within minutes.</i>

1188
01:29:40,899 --> 01:29:43,032
<i>Now, no one is sure how or why,</i>

1189
01:29:43,057 --> 01:29:47,149
<i>but this seems to be happening
simultaneously around the world.</i>

1190
01:29:49,454 --> 01:29:50,845
What's goin' on?

1191
01:29:51,259 --> 01:29:52,618
The Orca.

1192
01:29:53,696 --> 01:29:54,899
What?

1193
01:29:55,454 --> 01:29:57,688
I wonder who could
have done this.

1194
01:30:02,712 --> 01:30:03,805
Maddie?

1195
01:30:11,844 --> 01:30:12,860
Maddie.

1196
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:19,821
First contact,
you're gonna start

1197
01:30:19,868 --> 01:30:21,727
losing your long-range vision.

1198
01:30:21,752 --> 01:30:24,235
When you surface, motor skills
are gonna start to fade,

1199
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:27,852
but I put a heliox mixture
in the tank which...

1200
01:30:27,877 --> 01:30:30,217
should help you stay
stable a little longer.

1201
01:30:32,014 --> 01:30:33,701
It was an honor.

1202
01:30:48,889 --> 01:30:50,389
Thank you.

1203
01:30:55,162 --> 01:30:56,475
My notes.

1204
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:00,537
Are you sure?

1205
01:31:02,772 --> 01:31:05,647
He fought for us,
died for us.

1206
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:09,139
He's not only proof that
coexistence is possible.

1207
01:31:11,209 --> 01:31:12,905
He is...

1208
01:31:12,944 --> 01:31:14,326
the key to it.

1209
01:31:17,342 --> 01:31:20,115
Take care of them, Mark.

1210
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:25,665
Bowman, take us out, fast.

1211
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:26,821
Aye, Captain.

1212
01:32:29,697 --> 01:32:30,962
He's clear.

1213
01:34:44,901 --> 01:34:46,877
Goodbye...

1214
01:34:48,112 --> 01:34:49,971
...old friend.

1215
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:25,138
You all right?

1216
01:35:26,427 --> 01:35:29,068
Bowman, send a distress
message to the Argo.

1217
01:35:29,093 --> 01:35:30,216
Aye, Captain.

1218
01:35:48,645 --> 01:35:50,122
See anything?

1219
01:36:57,129 --> 01:36:58,927
Nobody move!

1220
01:37:36,413 --> 01:37:37,765
Are you okay?

1221
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:39,881
I know how to find him.

1222
01:37:45,765 --> 01:37:47,413
I know how to find him!

1223
01:37:49,147 --> 01:37:51,296
Let's make him proud,
not screw this up.

1224
01:37:53,374 --> 01:37:55,788
- How did he, uh...?
- By saving us.

1225
01:37:58,866 --> 01:38:00,530
Sam, what do we got going on?

1226
01:38:00,601 --> 01:38:03,452
We think Emma activated the
Orca somewhere near Boston.

1227
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:06,327
That's why Ghidorah and Godzilla
are both headed that way now.

1228
01:38:06,398 --> 01:38:08,506
But we haven't been able to
pinpoint the exact location

1229
01:38:08,663 --> 01:38:10,544
without the missing piece
of the Orca's signal.

1230
01:38:10,569 --> 01:38:11,999
I've got the missing piece.

1231
01:38:12,992 --> 01:38:15,170
It's Godzilla, right?
But I know we already tried...

1232
01:38:15,195 --> 01:38:16,882
It's not Godzilla.

1233
01:38:17,171 --> 01:38:18,210
It's us.

1234
01:38:18,241 --> 01:38:19,304
What do you mean "us"?

1235
01:38:19,329 --> 01:38:21,856
Emma combined the bioacoustics
of Godzilla with a human.

1236
01:38:21,881 --> 01:38:23,715
That's how she made the
signal for the Orca.

1237
01:38:23,748 --> 01:38:25,863
The creatures just think
it's another apex predator.

1238
01:38:25,888 --> 01:38:26,926
Well, that makes sense. I mean,

1239
01:38:26,951 --> 01:38:29,301
we are a bunch of horny,
murderous carnivores.

1240
01:38:29,326 --> 01:38:31,106
Yeah, that's real poetic.
Now, what?

1241
01:38:31,614 --> 01:38:33,692
We track it, we find it,
we get my daughter back.

1242
01:38:33,903 --> 01:38:36,426
What about Moe,
Larry and Curly over here?

1243
01:38:36,451 --> 01:38:38,622
Godzilla will bring balance.

1244
01:38:38,747 --> 01:38:39,934
Oh, I get it.

1245
01:38:40,176 --> 01:38:42,940
A little Serizawa
let-'em-fight action.

1246
01:38:42,965 --> 01:38:44,809
I used to love it
when he said that.

1247
01:38:45,215 --> 01:38:47,161
No, this time we join the fight.

1248
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:53,019
What do you think you're doing?

1249
01:38:53,044 --> 01:38:54,556
I don't have time
to argue about this, Jonah.

1250
01:38:54,581 --> 01:38:55,806
I'm getting Maddie back.

1251
01:38:55,831 --> 01:38:57,448
Not with my men, you're not.

1252
01:38:58,372 --> 01:39:00,911
Emma, you said this was
about the greater good.

1253
01:39:00,936 --> 01:39:03,512
That the planet
deserved a clean slate.

1254
01:39:03,551 --> 01:39:05,684
But now you're prepared to
put all our lives in danger

1255
01:39:05,709 --> 01:39:07,364
because your little girl is missing.

1256
01:39:07,389 --> 01:39:09,762
- The Orca is with...
- The Orca no longer matters.

1257
01:39:09,787 --> 01:39:12,590
Man does not control
the laws of nature.

1258
01:39:13,926 --> 01:39:15,434
And neither do you.

1259
01:39:25,457 --> 01:39:27,450
I already lost one child.

1260
01:39:28,067 --> 01:39:29,668
I'm not losing another.

1261
01:39:30,645 --> 01:39:32,278
I have to fix this.

1262
01:39:33,637 --> 01:39:35,059
Let her go.

1263
01:39:36,489 --> 01:39:38,372
We have everything we need.

1264
01:41:40,519 --> 01:41:41,777
Oh, shit.

1265
01:43:11,567 --> 01:43:13,980
Okay, we've zeroed in on
the last ping from the Orca.

1266
01:43:14,005 --> 01:43:15,692
Fenway Park, dead ahead.

1267
01:43:15,717 --> 01:43:17,848
<i>We'll lay cover fire to
keep Ghidorah distracted.</i>

1268
01:43:17,873 --> 01:43:19,011
Copy that.

1269
01:43:21,067 --> 01:43:23,466
Colonel, all squadrons
are locked on target.

1270
01:43:24,059 --> 01:43:25,919
For Serizawa.

1271
01:44:00,698 --> 01:44:02,222
Is it just me, or...

1272
01:44:02,277 --> 01:44:03,550
has he been working out?

1273
01:44:03,613 --> 01:44:04,814
You kiddin' me?

1274
01:44:04,839 --> 01:44:07,347
Serizawa's got
that lizard juiced!

1275
01:44:07,372 --> 01:44:08,479
Damn right.

1276
01:44:09,659 --> 01:44:10,878
Oh, boy.

1277
01:44:10,917 --> 01:44:12,980
Godzilla's radiation levels
are goin' through the roof.

1278
01:44:13,005 --> 01:44:16,050
We got about 12 minutes
before he goes thermonuclear.

1279
01:44:16,075 --> 01:44:17,323
What do you mean?

1280
01:44:18,846 --> 01:44:20,612
I'm saying, in about 12 minutes,

1281
01:44:20,637 --> 01:44:23,198
it's gonna be a bad day
to be a Red Sox fan.

1282
01:44:24,456 --> 01:44:26,362
Okay, guys,
you need to find the Orca,

1283
01:44:26,387 --> 01:44:28,245
get Madison and get
the hell outta there!

1284
01:44:28,289 --> 01:44:31,055
<i>Whatever Serizawa did to Godzilla
worked a little too well,</i>

1285
01:44:31,108 --> 01:44:32,534
<i>'cause he's about to explode</i>

1286
01:44:32,575 --> 01:44:33,878
<i>like an atom bomb.</i>

1287
01:44:33,903 --> 01:44:35,777
- Watch left.
- Prepare for landing.

1288
01:44:57,155 --> 01:44:58,304
Go! Go!

1289
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:14,636
Madison!

1290
01:45:17,527 --> 01:45:18,728
I found something!

1291
01:45:18,753 --> 01:45:19,824
Over here!

1292
01:45:20,597 --> 01:45:21,824
Come check this out!

1293
01:45:24,722 --> 01:45:25,878
Are you alright?

1294
01:45:26,535 --> 01:45:28,261
I found the Orca, sir.

1295
01:45:28,332 --> 01:45:29,674
Looks pretty banged up.

1296
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:31,667
No sign of your daughter.

1297
01:45:38,214 --> 01:45:39,503
She's back there!

1298
01:45:39,675 --> 01:45:41,605
- We gotta get outta here!
- Let's go!

1299
01:46:57,599 --> 01:46:58,677
Get in!

1300
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,810
Incoming!

1301
01:47:04,873 --> 01:47:06,476
Get in!

1302
01:47:06,501 --> 01:47:07,882
Griffin, you alright?

1303
01:47:08,466 --> 01:47:09,896
Martinez, let's get her up!

1304
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:19,794
Where's Madison?

1305
01:47:19,819 --> 01:47:21,279
I don't know,
I thought she was there!

1306
01:47:21,304 --> 01:47:22,685
Well, she's not there!

1307
01:47:24,771 --> 01:47:26,248
I can't get anything!

1308
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:28,209
- Get that slack!
- Okay, okay!

1309
01:47:30,263 --> 01:47:31,295
Look out!

1310
01:47:33,709 --> 01:47:36,372
I hope you're as good as finding
her as you are of losing her.

1311
01:47:36,397 --> 01:47:37,670
I didn't lose her, she ran away!

1312
01:47:37,695 --> 01:47:39,076
Well, gee, I wonder why!

1313
01:47:39,101 --> 01:47:40,450
I can't blame that kid.

1314
01:47:40,475 --> 01:47:43,482
If I had these two for parents,
I'd run away from home, too.

1315
01:47:46,615 --> 01:47:47,826
What did you just say?

1316
01:47:47,851 --> 01:47:49,981
If I had the two of you for parents,

1317
01:47:50,006 --> 01:47:51,795
I'd run away from home, too.

1318
01:47:52,475 --> 01:47:53,771
- Home.
- Home.

1319
01:49:06,110 --> 01:49:09,032
Godzilla's radiation's
reaching critical mass!

1320
01:49:09,548 --> 01:49:11,071
Six minutes until he blows!

1321
01:49:11,096 --> 01:49:12,986
Order all remaining
craft to retreat!

1322
01:50:24,550 --> 01:50:26,644
Maddie!

1323
01:50:27,198 --> 01:50:29,652
- Madison!
- Maddie!

1324
01:50:30,574 --> 01:50:31,754
Madison!

1325
01:50:32,464 --> 01:50:34,144
Madison!

1326
01:50:34,886 --> 01:50:36,144
Madison!

1327
01:50:40,714 --> 01:50:41,839
Emma!

1328
01:50:43,057 --> 01:50:44,120
Maddie!

1329
01:50:44,206 --> 01:50:45,394
Martinez!

1330
01:50:45,667 --> 01:50:47,034
We got her. On three!

1331
01:50:47,059 --> 01:50:48,861
One, two, three!

1332
01:51:07,309 --> 01:51:09,145
Oh, my baby...

1333
01:51:11,645 --> 01:51:12,989
Is she breathing?

1334
01:53:20,304 --> 01:53:21,538
Roger that.

1335
01:53:21,563 --> 01:53:23,382
Osprey's comin' in two minutes!

1336
01:53:23,569 --> 01:53:25,053
We gotta work fast!

1337
01:53:25,078 --> 01:53:26,388
To do what?

1338
01:53:29,678 --> 01:53:30,895
You sure about this?

1339
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:32,310
It's the only way to save him.

1340
01:53:32,365 --> 01:53:34,098
We fix it, get on the Osprey,

1341
01:53:34,123 --> 01:53:35,584
draw that thing
away from Godzilla.

1342
01:53:35,787 --> 01:53:37,631
Buy him time to
get back on his feet.

1343
01:53:48,709 --> 01:53:50,107
Mark, you've seen
what that thing can do.

1344
01:53:50,132 --> 01:53:51,132
I know.

1345
01:53:51,157 --> 01:53:53,147
It'll be tight, but we
have to take that chance.

1346
01:54:00,818 --> 01:54:02,334
- Are you good to go?
- Yes.

1347
01:54:02,359 --> 01:54:04,793
All right, one, two,

1348
01:54:04,818 --> 01:54:05,897
three.

1349
01:54:09,795 --> 01:54:10,842
That's it.

1350
01:54:11,537 --> 01:54:12,732
That's it!

1351
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:23,397
Come on, Emma, let's go!

1352
01:54:23,584 --> 01:54:25,442
Okay. Take her, take her.

1353
01:54:25,467 --> 01:54:27,215
- I still have to activate it.
- What?

1354
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:29,131
I'm right behind you. Go!

1355
01:54:42,198 --> 01:54:43,206
Let's go!

1356
01:54:43,917 --> 01:54:44,940
Mom!

1357
01:54:46,229 --> 01:54:47,229
Mom!

1358
01:54:47,254 --> 01:54:48,354
Come on, Maddie!

1359
01:54:48,729 --> 01:54:50,143
Go, go, go!

1360
01:54:53,987 --> 01:54:56,073
Maddie, do you have pain
anywhere besides the leg?

1361
01:55:03,169 --> 01:55:05,684
- We gotta lift off, now!
- Wait!

1362
01:55:15,424 --> 01:55:17,049
Emma, let's go, come on!

1363
01:55:17,074 --> 01:55:18,081
Mom!

1364
01:55:34,824 --> 01:55:37,356
- No! Mom!
- Emma!

1365
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:15,923
No!

1366
01:56:18,110 --> 01:56:19,110
No!

1367
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:38,271
Mom!

1368
01:57:05,264 --> 01:57:07,233
Long live

1369
01:57:07,327 --> 01:57:08,788
the king.

1370
01:59:27,035 --> 01:59:28,278
Jesus.

1371
01:59:29,309 --> 01:59:30,793
Good thing he's on our side.

1372
01:59:31,598 --> 01:59:32,637
For now.

1373
01:59:34,762 --> 01:59:35,832
Look.
